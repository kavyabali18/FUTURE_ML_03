# 🤖 AI Resume Screening & Candidate Ranking System

This project builds a Machine Learning–based Resume Screening System that automatically evaluates, scores, and ranks resumes based on their relevance to a given job description.

The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract skills, compare resumes with job requirements, and identify missing competencies — simulating how modern HR-tech platforms streamline hiring.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Hiring teams often receive hundreds of resumes for a single role. Manually reviewing them is time-consuming and inconsistent.

This project automates that process by:

- Reading and processing resume text data
- Extracting skills and keywords
- Comparing resumes with job descriptions
- Scoring and ranking candidates
- Identifying skill gaps

The system is designed as a decision-support tool for recruiters and HR professionals.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build an intelligent resume screening system that can:

- Parse and clean resume text
- Extract relevant skills using NLP
- Analyze job descriptions
- Compute similarity between resumes and job roles
- Rank candidates based on job fit
- Highlight missing or weak skills

---

## 📁 Dataset

The project can use:

- Resume Dataset (text-based resumes)
- Job Description datasets
- Simulated or anonymized resume data

Data includes:
- Resume text content
- Job descriptions
- Skill-related keywords
